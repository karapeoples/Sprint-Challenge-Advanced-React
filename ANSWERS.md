- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Simply to keep the concepts in mind because documentation will be written this way for a while still yet and being able to write and understand them helps you to read them and be able to convert them.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

componentDidMount --- this is a use effect that allows you to fetch api data and set it to state and make sure it is renderable.

componentDidUpdate---if you need what is on screen to show parts of the componentDidMount lifecycle stage while introducing new information this is the lifecycle method you would go to.

render ---- render is what the above to lifecycles and all class/functional components depend on to bring information to the screen.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

To be a piece of code that can be dynamically used to change or set State for different purposes either within the same app or to be brought into new components elsewhere

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

To make sure what we want to happen does. It also guards against either us or others changing the code so that we can be sure it is working properly before production.
